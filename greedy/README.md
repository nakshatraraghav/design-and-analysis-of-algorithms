## Greedy Approach

The greedy approach is a problem solving strategy in which the algorithm chooses
the best option available(locally optimal choice) to it at every step in hopes of finding the
best global optimal solution

this type of algorithm chooses the best option available to it currently, without considering
the long term effects of that choice

The approach is called "greedy" because the algorithm always chooses the option that seems to be the best at the moment, without considering whether it might be better to wait and see what other options become available in the future.

Often used in optimization problems

While the greedy approach can be simple and efficient, it may not always produce the best solution, and it is important to check whether the solution produced by the algorithm is indeed optimal. In some cases, a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or branch-and-bound, may be needed to find the optimal solution
