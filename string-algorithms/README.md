## String Matching Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various string matching algorithms in C++.

Rabin Karp and KMP algorithms are both more efficient than the naive string matching algorithm and are used in practice.

Their time complexity is O(n+m) where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.

Whereas the naive string matching algorithm has a time complexity of O(nm).
