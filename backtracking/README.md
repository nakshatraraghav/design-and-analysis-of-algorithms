## Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying out different
possible solutions and rejecting those that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point

#### Explain Backtracking technique like Jessie Pinkman

Yo, listen up. So, you got this problem that needs solvin', right? And you got some rules or constraints that you gotta follow, or some requirements that you gotta meet, but you don't know the solution yet.

That's where backtracking comes in, yo. It's like, you start with a guess, and then you try it out, see if it works. If it does, cool, you keep goin' down that path, tryin' out different possibilities and keepin' track of what works and what doesn't.

But if your guess doesn't work, then you gotta backtrack, like, take a step back and try a different guess. And you keep doin' this, back and forth, until you find a solution that satisfies all the constraints, or you've exhausted all the possibilities and there's no solution that works.

It's like, you're makin' a trail through the woods, and every time you hit a dead end, you backtrack to the last fork in the road and try a different path. And you keep doin' this until you find your way out of the woods.

So, that's backtracking, yo. It's all about trial and error, and keepin' track of what works and what doesn't, until you find the right solution. And if you don't find it, well, at least you know what doesn't work, right?
