## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem only once
(this first step of Dynamic Programming is similar to divide and conquer) but later
the results of each calculation are stored into a table to avoid redundant
calculations,

This problem is used to solve those problems in which the sub-problems are recurriung

The advantage of dynamic programming is that it can lead to efficient algorithms for complex problems by avoiding redundant calculations. However, the technique requires careful analysis of the problem structure and may not always be applicable
