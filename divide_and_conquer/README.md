## Divide And Conquer

The divide and conquer is problem solving technique in which the problem is broken
down into more and more subproblems that in themselves are easier to solve as
compared to the orignal problem

the subproblems then are individually solved and then their solution in combined to
result into the solution of the main problem

Basic steps of the Divide and Conquer Strategy are:

1. Divide: The problem is broken down into easier smaller sub-problems that are
   easier to solve

2. Conquer: Each subproblem is then independently solved

3. Combine: Their solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to solve the orignal problem
